Common requirements and recommendations for Keboola APIs.

# HTTP Headers

All requests should accept these headers:

* *X-StorageApi-Token*  - storage
* *X-KBC-RunId* - Identificator of one bussiness job. This value should be passed to all logs and events as `runId`. If not set component should generate one itself using Storage API Tickets service. Read more in [http://documentation.keboola.com/ingtegrating-kbc#Logging]


## HTTP Response Codes

HTTP status code described below should be returned by service:

### Success responses

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>200 <code>OK</code></td>
        <td>The request was successful.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>201 <code>Created</code></td>
        <td>The request was successful and a new resource was created.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>202 <code>Accepted</code></td>
        <td>Asynchronous request - The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. Response must contain URL of resource to poll for result.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>204 <code>No Content</code></td>
        <td>The request was successful but there is nothing to return. Usually response of DELETE requests.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Error responses
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>400 <code>Bad Request</code></td>
        <td>The request was invalid. Usually caused by invalid input data (missing arguments, invalid arguments values, etc.).  Cause of error is described in response.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>401 <code>Unauthorized</code></td>
        <td>Authentication failed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>403 <code>Forbidden</code></td>
        <td>You don't have access to resource.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>404 <code>Not Found</code></td>
        <td>You're asking for something that doesn't exist.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>500 <code>Internal Server Error</code></td>
        <td>Something went wrong. We are sorry, it is our fault and we will make our best to fix it!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>503 <code>Temporary Unavailable</code></td>
        <td>This response is typically returned when system is under maintenance.
            Maintenance reason and expected maintenance ent time are also returned in response.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


## HTTP Verbs

* `GET` Used for retrieving resources
* `POST` Used for creating resources
* `PUT` Used for updating existing resources
* `DELETE` Used for deleting resources


## Parameters
Many API methods take optional parameters. For GET requests, 
any parameters not specified as a segment in the path can be passed as an HTTP query string parameter.

For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests, parameters not included in the URL should be encoded as JSON.

    curl -i -H 'X-StorageApi-Token: your_token' -d '{"name":"my table"}'
## Responses

* API should be **JSON** only
* Resource URI must be returned in `uri` property
* Any possible metadata related to request or resource should be returned in custom HTTP headers

--
Sample connector's API calls required for orchestration 
--

### Get date of last run and optionally order to force run

This call is optional. If not implemented, orchestrator will run configured job on this connector without this check.

GET /check
> X-StorageApi-Token: 123456
< 200
< Content-Type: application/json
{ 
    "lastRunDate": "2012-09-14T10:27:04+01:00", 
    "forceRun": false
}


### Run connector's job for selected user or his account

#### Parameters

* **account** (optional) - imports either chosen account or all accounts for current user

POST /run
> X-StorageApi-Token: 123456
> Content-Type: application/json
{ 
    "account": 1
}
< 200
< Content-Type: application/json
{ 
    "duration": 123.11
}
